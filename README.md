# Photon
This is a fork repo of the original [MGPUSim](https://github.com/sarchlab/mgpusim) simulator. We integrated a new sampled GPU methodology to speedup the simulation rate of the MGPUSim.
We are working at merging this project with the main branch of the MGPUSim. The progress report will be shown here.
